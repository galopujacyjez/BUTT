Bespoke Utilizable Terran Templates

Terran front, back and side are the main livery decals, you can place them spaced evenly on four sides of the tank,
they should fit perfectly (one triangle row will overlap to help with alignment, so you can adjust the depth on side decals to hide them).
The Terran front decal contains a guide for scaling the relativity logo - the logo decal is optimized for resolution so you'll need to scale it yourself.
Same with the Terran logo and the US flag.

Good luck and have fun!
